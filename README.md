## EmailJS Integration
The form in this project uses EmailJS, a service that allows sending emails directly from the client-side using JavaScript. The following steps describe how to set up the EmailJS integration.

1. **EmailJS Initialization**: 
   - The EmailJS service is initialized in the JavaScript code using the following:
     ```javascript
     emailjs.init("YOUR PUBLC KEY");
     ```

2. **Sending Emails**:
   - When the form is submitted, the userâ€™s input (name, email, and message) is sent to the configured EmailJS service using the `emailjs.send` method.

3. **EmailJS Configuration**:
   - Service ID: `YOUR SERVICE ID`
   - Template ID: `YOUR TEMPLATE ID`
   - Public Key: `YOUR PUBLIC KEY`

   These values must be configured in your EmailJS account to work correctly.
